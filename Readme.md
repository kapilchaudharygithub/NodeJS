## What is Node.JS?
- JS is primarily used inside Browsers just because of JS Engines and each browser has their own JS engine and famous JS engine was **V8 Engine**.
- **Ryan Dahl** embedded **V8 Engine** with C++ and called it as  **Node.JS**
- We can run JS outside of the browser.
- JS can talk to native machines  because of C++( like file handling and more).
- We can create webservers in JS Language.
- **Node.JS is a runtime environment for JS**
